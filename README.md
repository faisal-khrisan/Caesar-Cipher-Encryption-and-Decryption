# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-and-Decryption
This Python app implements a simple Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
# Features:
* Encryption: Encodes a message by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

* ecryption: Decodes a message by reversing the shift applied during encryption.

* Interactive Interface: Allows the user to choose between encoding and decoding, input a message, and specify the shift amount.

* Loop Functionality: The program can be run multiple times until the user decides to stop.

# How to Use:
1- Run the script.

2- The program will display a logo and prompt you to choose between encoding and decoding.

3- Enter your message and specify the shift number.

4- The program will display the encoded or decoded result.

5- You can choose to continue or stop the program after each operation.

# Example Output:
![{FE3DF12C-900E-4615-9886-5D2E93B8CA22}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73311a77-53f7-486b-b7c2-997e64f8a021)
